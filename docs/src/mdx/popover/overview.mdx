Popover has a number of triggers which provides an ability to show and hide the component in different ways:

- Click mode shows the component when a user clicks on the host element and hides when the user clicks somewhere on the document outside the component.

- Hint provides capability to show the component when the user hovers over the host element and hide when the user hovers out of the host.

- Focus mode is applied when user focuses the element.
